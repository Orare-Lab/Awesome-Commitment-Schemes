# KZG Polynomial Commitment

[toc]

This page introduces the polynomial commitment schemes proposed by Kate, Zaverucha, and Goldberg in [KZG10](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf). This commitment can be opened at any position of this polynomial, which means that anyone can prove the value of the polynomial at any point without revealing the whole polynomial.

## Two Constructions of KZG commitment

### PolyCommit_DL

### PolyCommit_PED
