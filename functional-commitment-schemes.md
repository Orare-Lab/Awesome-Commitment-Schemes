# Functional commitment schemes

Functional commitment schemes are a generalization of vector commitment schemes. The commitment is a short commitment to a function, which supports opening the commitment at specific positions with small proof without opening the whole function.

Functional commitment schemes consist of vector commitment schemes and polynomial commitment schemes.
